# Fibonacci-Method-Gradient-Descent
An implementation of the Fibonacci method for gradient descent, featuring a TKinter GUI for inputting the function / parameters to be examined and a matplotlib plot of the function and results.

The geeks for geeks guide on embedding Matplotlib into Tkinter found here (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-embed-matplotlib-charts-in-tkinter-gui/) was consulted to figure out how to embed the graph properly.

TODO:
 - re-use axis for multiple plots, improving usability
